#ColorGame

The idea of this game is to show the user a color and they have a short amount of time to put something in front of the webcam that is similar in color and the game score them based on close they were.

I had difficulties creating an system to show how similar colors were, as human perception of color is complicated. I also found other things to do.

This project is currently not being worked on.
